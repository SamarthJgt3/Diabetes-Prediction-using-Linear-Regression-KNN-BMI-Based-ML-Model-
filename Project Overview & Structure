🔹 Overview

This project demonstrates a Machine Learning implementation for predicting diabetes using patient BMI values. 

The model uses supervised learning techniques including Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification.

The objective is to analyze the relationship between BMI and diabetes occurrence and evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.

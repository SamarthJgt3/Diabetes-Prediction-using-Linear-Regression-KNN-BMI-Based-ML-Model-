# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression-KNN-BMI-Based-ML-Model-
This project implements a Machine Learning module to predict diabetes using BMI as the independent variable. The model is trained using Scikit-learn and evaluated using accuracy metrics. The dataset contains patient health information, and the target variable indicates whether a patient has diabetes (Y/N).
